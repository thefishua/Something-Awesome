# Something-Awesome
## The Project
This project represents 30+ hours of work in creating a rubber ducky that performs both a changing of a person's wallpaper and a reverse shell that occurs at 1pm daily for a windows device. During this project I learned a lot about microcontrollers, using raspberrypi's as tools for both malicious and ethical activity and some reflection on how I could've made the project even better. Below I talk about how to install the raspberry pi OS and an overview of a HID device, The changing of a wallpaper script, reverse shells and a final reflection on the project. 

## Installing Raspberry Pi Zero OS and What is a HID Device

Summary:
- Download raspberry pi imager from the raspberry pi website 
- Write to an SD card the specific OS for the machine recommend Raspbian 
- Update modules and drivers in config.txt and etc/modules on the raspberrypi
- Use a configuration file to enable the raspberry pi to be ion gadget mode
- During this process you may come across a coloured screen when starting up the raspberry pi. If this occurs like it did for me you have bricked the system and must restart the process of installing the OS.
- In the blog there is a simple script called example.py and to run:
```
? sudo python3 example.py
```
