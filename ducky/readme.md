The USB Rubber Ducky is a Human Interface Device programmable with a simple scripting language allowing penetration testers to quickly and easily craft and deploy security auditing payloads that mimic human keyboard input. Tools and payloads can be found at usbrubberducky.com. Quack!

DuckBerry Pi is a Raspberry Pi distro. based on Minibian which allows the Raspberry Pi Zero to behave similar to a [USB Rubber Ducky](https://hakshop.com/products/usb-rubber-ducky-deluxe): a small device USB device which emulates a keyboard and automates key entry.
Ducky scripts (uncompiled) which are made for the USB Rubber Ducky can be used with the Duckyberry Pi without modification. This can be useful for automating computer tasks, penetration testing machines, playing pranks, or just fun (by default plugging in an untouched Duckberry Pi image will open a Youtube video).
Since it is recognised as a standard keyboard, this tool is compatible with Windows, Mac OS, Linux, Android, PlayStation 4, and anything that supports a USB keyboard.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you setup and install your own Duckberry

### Installation

1) Download the ISO for [Rasbian Lite 2016-02-29](http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_lite/images/raspbian_lite-2016-02-29/) Other versions may work but I have only tested with this.

2) Burn the ISO to the Micro SD Card - if you can't do this, [Google can help!](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=burn+raspbian+lite+to+sd+card)

3) Version 1 includes a setup script that automates the setting up from version 0.5. Download this using wget.
    ``` bash
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ossiozac/Raspberry-Pi-Zero-Rubber-Ducky-Duckberry-Pi/master/duckysetup.sh
    ```

4) Make the script executable
    ``` bash
        chmod +x duckysetup.sh
    ```
   
5) Run the script
   ``` bash
       sudo ./duckysetup.sh
   ```
   
### Using Duckberry
   
6) Turn off the PI, plug it into the target host machine via USB cable in the peripheral micro USB port, NOT THE POWER PORT.  A power cord is not required as the Pi Zero will take power directly from the host machine.
    
7) Watch the script execute on the host machine - You may have to plug it in twice, the first time installs drivers.

8) Once the default script runs you can unplug and take the SD card out of the PI, plug it into any machine with a USB SD card adaptor and then change /boot/payload.dd file to any DuckyScript Payload. This is what file the Pi will inject into the target device.

## Duckyscript

There are lots of [ready made ducky scripts here](https://github.com/hak5darren/USB-Rubber-Ducky/wiki/Payloads) and you can make your own with [this generator](https://ducktoolkit.com/). Just make sure you use uncompiled Ducky Script .dd extension not .bin.

A .dd file is a standard .txt file with the extension chanaged. To clear up some confusion, the DuckToolKit will give you an option to download a compiled inject.bin file or a duckycode.txt file. You need to download the duckycode.txt file and change the name/extension to payload.dd and then put it in the /boot part of the SD card so that the Pi can load and run the script.
